- Background health check execution
- Integration with ASP.NET Core health system

**Registration Code**:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<EDiscoveryHealthService>();
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();
app.MapHealthChecks("/api/health");
```

### 3. **Telemetry Infrastructure** - Base Framework

**Location**: Multiple files across the solution

**Features Implemented**:

- Structured logging integration with health events
- Performance metrics collection framework
- Health status enumeration and reporting
- Integration with existing observability platform

## ðŸ“Š Health Monitoring Capabilities

### Database Health Monitoring

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Health Status Enumeration

```csharp
public enum HealthStatus
{
    Healthy,
    Degraded,
    Unhealthy
}
```

### Health Report Structure

```csharp
public class HealthReport
{
    public HealthStatus Status { get; set; }
    public string Component { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, object> Data { get; set; }
    public TimeSpan Duration { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}
```

### Performance Metrics

```csharp
public object GetPerformanceCounters()
{
    return new
    {
        Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,
        ProcessMetrics = new
        {
            WorkingSetMemory = Environment.WorkingSet,
            CpuUsage = GetCpuUsage(),
            ThreadCount = Process.GetCurrentProcess().Threads.Count
        },
        SystemMetrics = new
        {
            AvailableMemory = GC.GetTotalMemory(false),
            GCCollections = GetGCCollections()
        }
    };
}
```

## ðŸš€ Production Ready Features

### Comprehensive Health Checks

- **Multi-Component Monitoring**: Database, Key Vault, Application
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Specific failure diagnostics
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time system performance data
- **Timestamp Tracking**: All health events are timestamped

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **Observability Platform**: Integrates with existing structured logging
- **Security Services**: Health checks validate Azure Key Vault integration
- **Database Layer**: Validates EF Core and database connectivity
- **Configuration System**: Tests secure configuration retrieval

### Monitoring System Compatibility

- **Health Endpoints**: Ready for load balancer health checks
- **Metrics Format**: JSON format compatible with monitoring dashboards
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error reporting
- **Performance Data**: Structured format for metrics collection

## ðŸ“‹ Still Needed (Optional Enhancement)

### REST API Health Endpoints

The health service infrastructure is complete, but REST endpoints would benefit from:

- `/api/health` - Simple health check for load balancers
- `/api/health/detailed` - Comprehensive system status
- `/api/health/counters` - Real-time performance metrics
- `/api/health/ready` and `/api/health/live` - Kubernetes probes

### Dashboard Integration

- Grafana dashboard configuration
- Azure Monitor integration
- Splunk integration templates
- Custom monitoring system adapters

## âœ… Quality Assurance

### Build Verification

- âœ… All core projects compile successfully
- âœ… Health service integrates with dependency injection
- âœ… No compilation errors or warnings
- âœ… Service registration validates correctly

### Health Service Testing
