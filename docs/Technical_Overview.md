- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Real-time worker health tracking with automatic failover
- **Dead Letter Handling**: Failed jobs automatically reassigned to healthy workers
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: DbContextFactory pattern ensures safe concurrent database access

**Concurrent Processing Flow**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U1 as User 1
    participant U2 as User 2
    participant API as Intake API
    participant W1 as Worker 1
    participant W2 as Worker 2
    participant DB as Database

    U1->>API: Create Job A
    U2->>API: Create Job B
    API->>DB: Insert Jobs (Pending)

    W1->>DB: GetNextAvailableJob()
    DB->>W1: Return Job A (Locked)
    W2->>DB: GetNextAvailableJob()
    DB->>W2: Return Job B (Locked)

    par Processing Job A
        W1->>W1: Process Collection
        W1->>DB: Update Progress
        W1->>DB: Heartbeat
    and Processing Job B
        W2->>W2: Process Collection
        W2->>DB: Update Progress
        W2->>DB: Heartbeat
    end

    W1->>DB: Complete Job A
    W2->>DB: Complete Job B
```

**Locking Mechanism**:

```csharp
public async Task<CollectionJob?> GetNextAvailableJobAsync(Guid workerId)
{
    using var context = _contextFactory.CreateDbContext();
    using var transaction = await context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();

    try
    {
        // Atomic job acquisition with pessimistic locking
        var job = await context.CollectionJobs
            .Where(j => j.Status == JobStatus.Pending)
            .OrderBy(j => j.CreatedAt)
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

        if (job != null)
        {
            // Create assignment with lock token
            var assignment = new JobAssignment
            {
                JobId = job.Id,
                WorkerId = workerId,
                LockToken = Guid.NewGuid(),
                AssignedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
                LastHeartbeat = DateTime.UtcNow
            };

            context.JobAssignments.Add(assignment);
            job.Status = JobStatus.Processing;

            await context.SaveChangesAsync();
            await transaction.CommitAsync();
        }

        return job;
    }
    catch
    {
        await transaction.RollbackAsync();
        throw;
    }
}
```

**Worker Registration and Health Monitoring**:

- **Dynamic Registration**: Workers register themselves on startup with capacity metrics
- **Heartbeat Interval**: 30-second health check intervals
- **Failure Detection**: Workers marked unhealthy after 90 seconds without heartbeat
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Orphaned jobs reassigned to healthy workers
- **Load Balancing**: Jobs distributed based on worker CPU and memory usage
