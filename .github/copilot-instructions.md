# Hybrid eDiscovery Collector - Project Setup Completed

This workspace contains a comprehensive hybrid eDiscovery collection system with the following key characteristics:

## Project Overview

- **Architecture**: .NET 8 solution with Web API and Worker Service
- **Platform**: Docker Compose for POC, Azure-ready for production
- **Purpose**: Intelligent routing between Microsoft Graph API and Graph Data Connect based on collection size

## Key Components

- **EDiscoveryIntakeApi**: REST API for job management with SQLite/Azure SQL support
- **HybridGraphCollectorWorker**: Automated collection service with intelligent routing
- **EDiscovery.Shared**: Common models, services, and AutoRouter logic

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Project structure scaffolded and configured
- ✅ Dependencies installed and verified
- ✅ Comprehensive logging implemented with Serilog
- ✅ Build verification completed successfully
- ✅ Runtime validation completed for logging system
- ✅ Documentation updated and completed

## Key Features Implemented

- **Comprehensive Structured Logging**: Enterprise-grade Serilog implementation with audit trails, performance monitoring, and correlation tracking
- **AutoRouter Service**: Intelligent routing between Graph API and Graph Data Connect
- **Chain of Custody**: SHA-256 hashing and audit logging for compliance
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for API throttling and error recovery
- **Multi-Output Support**: NAS and Azure Blob storage options

## Recent Enhancements

The logging system has been comprehensively upgraded with:

- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Separate audit logs with 365-day retention
- Performance metrics and throughput monitoring
- Error handling with full stack traces
- ComplianceLogger service for eDiscovery-specific requirements

All components are fully functional and validated in runtime environment.
